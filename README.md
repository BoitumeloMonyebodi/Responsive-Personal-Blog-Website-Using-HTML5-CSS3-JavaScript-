# My Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog project! This project demonstrates my skills in web development, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and responsive design.

## Project Overview

This website features a personal blog where I share my journey as a web developer, the tools I use, and insights into the tech industry. The site has three main pages:

1. **Home (index.html)** – The landing page, including a hero section, an introduction, and a preview of the blog posts.
2. **About Me (about.html)** – A page that describes who I am, my background, and my passion for web development.
3. **Contact (contact.html)** – A page with a contact form that allows visitors to reach out to me directly.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.
- **Dynamic "Read More" Button**: On the home page, each blog post preview has a "Read More" button that expands to show the full content.
- **Contact Form**: Users can send me messages through the contact form, which includes simple form validation (name, email, and message fields are required).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, using flexbox for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, such as the "Read More" button and form validation.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Through media queries to ensure a good experience on any device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
